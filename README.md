#   Python Lab EC Code Enhancements

1. I attempted Part A of the EC, and I successfully completed refactoring and increasing code readability and editability.
2. I faced the challenge of not reading instructions well enough. as well as not knowing how to best print the correct intro message before that room's inputs. I settled on a dictionairy, with a key of the status and an output of the correct message to introduce the input. As well, I used a string instead of an int for the status to improve readability, though that did create some minor challenges.
